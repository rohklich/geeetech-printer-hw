I 3d printed a part to be able to connect to the felxible flat cable(FFC) with 1.0mm pitch. However its not necessary, my 1st version was a piece of scrap wood where i carved in some grooves with a knife for the wires.

Please note how the pinout on the FFC adapter changed as it is connected to the LCD vs the board.
Use a continuity tester to find GND pin as orientation.
